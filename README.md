# Games Unit Prject
This repository will ultimately hold the game you create for your unit 2 project.

You might have noticed that it's a bit more sparse than previous starter repos we've given you. That's because you will be responsible for creating this project from start to finish. You are welcome to use the code and files from previous projects and labs, but what you use will be up to you.

Below, we'll explain the pieces of the project we expect you to have:

## planning
Here is a link to my planning document:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tzypYbVNszvDDIgxKYkBryFvy6eyOFPzTytk1Ee7mT0/edit?usp=sharing

## game.py
When we run this file, your game should run.

Of course, you are welcome to create additional files and modules and import them into your `game.py` file.

## playtest.md
This file should document your team's plan for play testing your game during the development process. You can also record notes and reflections from your play tests here.

We'll talk more in class about best practices for play testing

## assessment.md
This is where you will self-assess your project. This assessment will be slightly different from past assessments. Rather than doing it all at once at the end, you should update it periodically throughout your project's development process.

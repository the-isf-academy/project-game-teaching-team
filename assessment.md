# Game Project Self Assessment
For this unit, you will demonstrate your learning through your engagement with
the concepts and skills specific to object-oriented programming we have covered
in this unit as well as general concepts and skills present throughout the
world of computer science. Your engagement with each criterion will be evidenced
by elements included in your project. However, this evidence alone may not speak
to depth to which you engaged with the criteria. As such, in addition to
providing specific pieces of evidence you should provide a justification for how
the piece(s) of evidence you identified demonstrate your level of engagement with
the criterion.

View the [full rubric](https://cs.fablearn.org/projects/2-game%20project.html) to see examples of evidence and justification
for each criterion.

### Using the rubric
For each criterion you should:

1. Read the description of the criterion as it applies to this project.
1. Identify 1-5 elements of your project that evidence your engagement with the criterion.
1. Justify how the piece(s) of evidence demonstrate your engagement with the criteria.
1. Determine the level between 1-8 that represents your engagement with the criterion based on the evidence and justification.

## Criterion A: Knowing, understanding, and computational thinking
*In this unit, we explored the **object-oriented programming paradigm**.
This allowed us to **cluster related data into objects** and identify
repeatedly used clusters of data to form **classes of objects**. Further,
we explored the **inheritance and composition relationships** of classes
to allow for extended functionality.*

## Criterion B: Planning and development
*In this unit, you saw different approaches to **planning a project** as
well as an approach to **incremental feature development**. Additionally,
you **collaborated on a project as a group**. Finally, you have
experienced the importance of the **documentation of a project** to those trying to use the project.*

## Criterion C: Evaluation
*Throughout the unit, you learned to **use a suite of tests to make sure
your code was functioning** as expected. Additionally, during the project
you **play-tested your game** with another group in order to get feedback
on specific elements of your gameâ€™s functionality or playability.*

## Criterion D: Reflecting on the impacts of technology
*Throughout the unit, we explored a variety of different games and
considered the **impact games have on players**. Games offer a medium to
**explore new narratives**, provide a venue for **artistic expression**,
and create a context to **experience emotions**.*
